# DTU - 02324 Advance Programming - RoboRally

### Introduction
We are a group of students at the Technical University of Denmark, who have been assigned a project in the course Advanced Programming held at the DTU Compute institute. In this course, we have received an initial version of the board game RoboRally. This initial version did not contain the actual game itself, but it did hold some of the fundamental logic and features, which we expanded upon by adding our own implementations and modifications.

### Tutuorial to connect to server
1. In order to use this application with the server, you must first clone our other repository called RoboRallyServer_GR15, provided by the link: https://github.com/HussiDTU/RoboRallyServer_GR15 

2. When this is done, you can run the server. While the server is running, you can start the game. 

3. When the game is running, in the menu choose: Multiplayer -> Host a new game

4. Now you can play, and for each move on the board, a new updated version of the JSON file will be sent from client to server.
